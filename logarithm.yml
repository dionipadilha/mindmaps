Logarithm: #  inverse of exponentials
  
  Definition: #
    - y = log(x, b) # b raised to the power of y equals x
    - example # log(8, 2) = 3 because 2^3 = 8

  Properties: # (b > 0, b â‰  1)
    - logarithm of 1 to any base # log(1, b) = 0
    - logarithm of the base itself # log(b, b) = 1
    - inverse relationship with exponentiation # b^log(x, b) = x
    - change of base # log(x, a) <==> log(x, b) / log(a, b)

  Types:
    - Common logarithm # log(x, 10)
    - Natural logarithm # log(x), log(x, e) where e ~ 2.7
