Logarithm: #  inverse of exponentials
  
  Definition: #
    - y = log(x, b) # b raised to the power of y equals x
    - example # log(8, 2) = 3 because 2^3 = 8

  Properties: # when (b > 0, b â‰  1)
    - logarithm of 1 # log(1, b) = 0
    - logarithm of the base itself # log(b, b) = 1
    - inverse relationship with exponentiation # b^log(x, b) = x

  Identities:
    - product rule   # log(m * n, b) <==> log(m, b) + log(n, b)
    - quotient rule  # log(m/n, b)   <==> log(m, b) - log(n, b)
    - power rule     # log(m^n, b)   <==> n * log(m, b)
    - change of base # log(x, a)     <==> log(x, b) / log(a, b)

    
  Types:
    - Common logarithm # log(x, 10)
    - Natural logarithm # log(x), log(x, e) where e ~ 2.7
