Quadratic Equations:
  Main:
    - Quadratic Equation # a*x^2 + b*x + c == 0
    - Delta # d := b^2 - 4*a*c
    - Roots # x':= (-b - d)/2*a and x":= (-b + d)/2*a
    - Vertex # vx := -b/2*a and vy := -d/4*a
  Interpretations:
    Concavity: #
    - a > 0 # U
    - a < 0 # iU (inverted U-shaped)
    Discriminant: # \Delta
    - d > 0 # distinct roots
    - d = 0 # equal roots
    - d < 0 # complex roots
