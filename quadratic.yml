Quadratic Equations:
  Quadratic Equation: # x^2
    - equation # a*x^2 + b*x + c == 0
    - discriminant # d := b^2 - 4*a*c
  NotablePoints:
    - roots # x':= (-b - d)/2*a and x":= (-b + d)/2*a
    - vertex # (vx, vy) := (-b/2a, -d/4a)
    - y-axis intercept  # (0, f(0)) := c --> independent term
  Concavity:
    - a > 0 # U
    - a < 0 # iU (inverted U-shaped)
  Discriminant: # \Delta
    - d > 0 # distinct roots
    - d = 0 # equal roots
    - d < 0 # complex roots
