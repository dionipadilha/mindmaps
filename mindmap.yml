PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM: #mindmap.yaml
  Main:
    - sum of the squares of the legs = square of the hypotenuse
    - formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2 # {a,b: legs, c: hypotenuse}
    - pythagorean trio 3,4,5 #key
    - make sure the triangle is rectangle #gotcha
  Function:
    - defines right triangles
    - geometry, trigonometry and several other areas
  Concepts:
    - right angle # 90 degrees
    - right triangle # triangle with right angle
    - legs # smaller sides
    - hypotenuse # side opposite to the right angle
  Demonstrations:
    - similarity of triangles # geometric
    - square method # visual
    - algebraic # formal
  Applications:
    - calculate unknown side in right triangles
    - find diagonal of squares/rectangles
    - determine distance between points
    - determine whether the angle is right
  Limitations:
    - does not apply to non-right triangles #gotcha
    - not valid in non-Euclidean geometries
  Extensions:
    - law of cosines # non-right triangles
    - pythagorean reciprocal theorem
    - Fermat's last theorem # x^n + y^n = z^n
    - Thales theorem # similar triangles
    - Euclid's theorem # generalization area of triangles
