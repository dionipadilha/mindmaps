### How to Solve Quadratic Equations

Solving quadratic equations is a fundamental skill in algebra that involves finding the values of the variable that satisfy the equation. Quadratic equations are generally in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. This guide will explain three primary methods for solving these equations: factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square.

#### Understanding Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations are polynomial equations of the second degree, meaning the highest exponent of the variable $x$ is 2. The general form is:
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where:
- $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$,
- $b$ is the coefficient of $x$,
- $c$ is the constant term.

#### Factoring

Factoring involves expressing the quadratic equation as a product of two binomials. This method is efficient when the quadratic equation can be easily decomposed. Hereâ€™s how to factor a quadratic equation:

1. **Rewrite the Equation:** Start with the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
2. **Find Two Numbers:** Identify two numbers that multiply to $ac$ (the product of the coefficient of $x^2$ and the constant term) and add up to $b$ (the coefficient of $x$).
3. **Decompose the Middle Term:** Rewrite the middle term $bx$ using the two numbers found.
4. **Factor by Grouping:** Group the terms into two pairs and factor out the common factors from each pair.
5. **Set Each Factor to Zero:** Solve the resulting linear equations.

For example, consider the equation $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$:
1. The equation is already in the correct form.
2. We need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3.
3. Rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0$.
4. Group the terms: $(x^2 + 2x) + (3x + 6) = 0$.
5. Factor each group: $x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0$.
6. Factor out the common binomial: $(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$.
7. Set each factor to zero: $x + 2 = 0$ or $x + 3 = 0$.

Thus, the solutions are $x = -2$ and $x = -3$.

#### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is a universal method that works for all quadratic equations. The formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

To use this method, follow these steps:
1. **Identify Coefficients:** Determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
2. **Plug into the Formula:** Substitute these values into the quadratic formula.
3. **Simplify:** Simplify the expression under the square root (the discriminant) and calculate the two possible values of $x$.

For example, for the equation $2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0$:
1. $a = 2$, $b = 3$, $c = -2$.
2. Substitute into the formula:
   $$x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 2}$$
3. Simplify:
   $$x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4}$$
   $$x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{4}$$
   $$x = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}$$
4. Calculate the two solutions:
   $$x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$
   $$x = \frac{-8}{4} = -2$$

Thus, the solutions are $x = \frac{1}{2}$ and $x = -2$.

#### Completing the Square

Completing the square is another method that involves transforming the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial. Follow these steps:

1. **Start with the Equation:** Begin with $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
2. **Move the Constant Term:** Rearrange the equation to $ax^2 + bx = -c$.
3. **Divide by $a$:** Ensure the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1 by dividing the entire equation by $a$.
4. **Complete the Square:** Add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ inside the equation.
5. **Form a Perfect Square:** Rewrite the left side as a binomial square.
6. **Solve for $x$:** Take the square root of both sides and solve for $x$.

For example, for the equation $x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$:
1. Move the constant: $x^2 + 6x = -5$.
2. Complete the square: $x^2 + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9$ (add and subtract $9$, which is $(\frac{6}{2})^2$).
3. Rewrite as a perfect square: $(x + 3)^2 = 4$.
4. Solve for $x$:
   $$x + 3 = \pm 2$$
   $$x = -3 \pm 2$$
   $$x = -1 \text{ or } x = -5$$

Thus, the solutions are $x = -1$ and $x = -5$.
