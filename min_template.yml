PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM:
  KeyPoints:
    - a^2 + b^2 = c^2 # a,b are legs, c is hypotenuse
    - Pythagorean Triple 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 #important
    - Applies to Right triangles only
  KeyConcepts:
    - Right angle, right triangle, legs, hypotenuse
    - geometric, visual (square method), algebraic demons
  Applications:
    - finding missing sides, diagonals, distances
    - checking right angles
  Limitations:
    - non-right triangles, non-Euclidean geometries
  Extensions:
    - Law of cosines, Fermat's last theorem
  Resources:
   - geobebra animation, exercises
