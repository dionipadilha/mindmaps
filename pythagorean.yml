Pythagorean Theorem:
  keyMemo: 3,4,5 # 3,4,5 (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2)
  Theorem:
    - sum of the squares of the legs = square of the hypotenuse
    - formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2 # {a,b: legs, c: hypotenuse}
    - make sure the triangle is rectangle #gotcha
  Concepts:
    - right angle # 90 degrees
    - right triangle # triangle with right angle
  Applications:
    - finding missing sides
    - checking right angles
  Limitations:
    - does not apply to non-right triangles #gotcha
    - not valid in non-euclidean geometries
  Extensions:
    - law of cosines # non-right triangles
    - pythagorean reciprocal theorem
    - Fermat's last theorem # x^n + y^n = z^n
    - Euclid's theorem # generalization area of triangles
